# CMAP 2007 Household Travel Survey Data Collection Details

## Geography
The survey covered the greater Chicago area, specifically 11 counties across Illinois and Indiana:
- **Illinois (8 counties):** Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will.
- **Indiana (3 counties):** Lake, LaPorte, Porter.

This region includes a mix of dense urban environments (Chicago), suburban areas, and rural outskirts.

## Vehicle Types
The survey collected "trip-level GPS data" from a sub-sample of households. The primary focus was on **household vehicles**.
- **Included:** Passenger vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, pickup trucks) used for personal travel.
- **Excluded:** The primary dataset generally excludes commercial heavy-duty trucks, buses, and fleet vehicles unless they were part of a specific household's primary transportation (which is rare for heavy-duty).
- **Note:** While CMAP models considers various distinct vehicle classes (passenger, light/medium/heavy trucks), this specific *Household* survey focuses on the vehicles owned and operated by the participating families.

## Road Types
Data was collected on all road types traversed by the participants during their daily travel.
- **Interstate/Expressways:** High-speed travel on the National Highway System (NHS) and regional expressways.
- **Arterials:** Major roads connecting economic centers.
- **Local Roads:** City streets and suburban/rural local roads.

No specific filter was applied to road type during collection; rather, the GPS traces reflect the natural distribution of household travel, which typically includes a mix of local streets (start/end of trips) and arterials/highways (commutes).

## Methodology Summary
- **Principal Investigator:** Stacey Bricka (NuStats).
- **Study Universe:** Over 3.2 million households across the 8 Illinois and 3 Indiana counties.
- **Sampling Strategy:** Dual frame approach combining Random Digit Dialing (RDD) and Directory/Address-based sampling.
- **Data Collection Mode:** Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI), mail questionnaires, and telephone interviews.
- **Response Rate:** Overall response rate was 10% (19% recruitment rate, 55% retrieval rate).
